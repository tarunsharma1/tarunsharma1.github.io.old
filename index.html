                    <p>I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the Serre Lab, Brown Univeristy. I have finished my undergraduation in computer science and engineering from PESIT, Bangalore, India. I am interested in the neural mechanisms underlying vision and perception, and building computational models of the same. I am intrigued by neural feedback in the visual cortex (in the image above, there is no white triangle). 
                      I am good with coding and familiar with deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and Caffe. I regard deep learning as a powerful tool to help us understand neural processes in the human brain.
                     At the Serre Lab, I am currently working on the behavioural analysis of animals using computer vision and deep learning. Below are some of my major projects.</p>

                    <p>Comparison of features used by humans, and those used by Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNs), for object recognition.
                        Created a web tool where a user reveals parts of an image until another user guess the category correctly. As a result, we compared these realization maps to ones from DCNs, found using LRP. We found that there was a very weak correlation between the same hence showing that humans and DCNs use different features for object recognition. We have published our findings in a workshop paper in ICCV 2017.

                    <p> This project is aimed at addressing one of the biggest issues faced in our country, garbage estimation. We use the computer vision techniques to estimate the volume of a mound of garbage using multiple images from a mobile phone crowdsourced app. There are three steps involved in this problem, segmentation of the garbage, 3D reconstruction, and volume estimation. For segmentation we have compared 3 methods, sliding window with edge thresholding, sliding window with feedforward neural networks, and bounding box segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks. For the 3D reconstruction, we have used Structure from Motion (SfM). For volume estimation we have used ball pivot method. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 85%. Our paper was accepted at ICVGIP 2016, India's premier computer vision conference.   </p>

                    <p> An end to end pipeline to assist the municipal committees of any city, to better tackle the problem of uncollected garbage distribution. 
                        This work was done in collaboration with an NGO, 'Jaanagraha'. We have used a Fast RCNN to detect uncollected garbage in an image. We then 
                        classify the garbage into construction debris / organic waste. We plot the distribution of garbage on a spatio temporal heat map of the city.
                        We assign every dump a priority, based on the places of interest near by. We have also implemented a novel before - after spot fix detection system
                        using deep learning, by comparing the fc7 features on a network trained on the MIT Places dataset. This gave us better results than SIFT

                    <p> Developed a navigational tool for the visually impaired which runs on a smart-phone, using computer vision algorithms and machine learning. Components involved were real time video stabilization using Kalman filters, depth estimation using optical flow, segmentation of approaching obstacle, classification of the obstacle using Neural Networks with Restricted Boltzmann Machine pre-training, and face recognition using FisherFaces. The obstacle detection from a single monocular camera, was inspired from a monocular depth cue used by our brains called motion parallax. It uses the fact that objects closer to us move at a faster rate than objects away from us. We used the same approach while tracking feature points on consquetive frames.

Created a maze in Unity and integrated it with Oculus rift and Oculus Audio SDK to recreate a depth map in terms of sound intensities. Also made a vibrating headset to provide tactile feedback. We were also able to stream frames from unity in real time using sockets to OpenCV and perform a face detection in real time.

                        <p>Published a Windows Store App which uses hand gesture recognition to allow the 
user to navigate through steps of baking a cake. This is done so that the user 
would not have to touch the laptop/tablet with his/her messy cake hands while 
baking. 
The app currently has 5,000 plus downloads from 120 different countries.  </p>

                        <p> Developed an android app recommender which recommends an app based on the 
user’s web browsing history and not  based on the app's he has downloaded so 
far, like is currently done. Three layers of filtering are done to recommend the most useful app to a user based on his present interests(based on content of most visited sites). We get the content tags of a website from SimilarWeb API and then scrape the play store to recommend an app which is most similar to the content(most number of similar tags).Extensively used Java, JSoup for parsing, JDBC. This project was selected in the top 33 of Inmobi Hack Day. </p>

                        <p>Worked under the guidance of Joe Paradiso and various members from the MIT media labs. Build a tool in order to spread awareness and visualize data, in an impactful way. A social issue would be compared to an event or an entity, which is local to the user. By providing comparisons in the user's location, the user will be able to relate to the numbers in a better way. The scale of the problem would 'make sense' to the user.  </p>

                        <p>Developed a Windows Phone App, which reads and sends accelerometer 
readings in real time using sockets. 
Made a server in NodeJS for the socket communication. 
The values are read and analysed in Java and accordingly, a keypress event is 
fired on the laptop using Java’s Robot Class. The user can hence play games like using his phone like how he would play using a 
Nintendo Wii, with no cost incurred. </p>
